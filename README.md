# Library-Management-System-
The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simplify and automate various tasks in a library. It offers functionalities for both librarians and library members. This system allows librarians to manage books, members, and fines efficiently, while members can borrow, return books, and pay fines. It involves designing a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the library system. The interface can be used as a librarian or as a student. A librarian manages members/students and books of the library. A librarian can view, register or remove members. They can also view books, add a book, remove a book, issue a book and collect dues/fines. The fine is applied as 3 rupees per day post the return due date of a book.
If a member is returning a book after the due date, the book will be returned and a balance will be due on the member. Before issuing a new book the balance will be paid by the member to the librarian. A member can view all available books, borrow a book, return a book, view their own books, and pay dues.
