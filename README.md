# Library-Management-System-
The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simplify and automate various tasks in a library. It offers functionalities for both librarians and library members. This system allows librarians to manage books, members, and fines efficiently, while members can borrow, return books, and pay fines. It involves designing a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the library system. The interface can be used as a librarian or as a student. A librarian manages members/students and books of the library. A librarian can view, register or remove members. They can also view books, add a book, remove a book, issue a book and collect dues/fines. The fine is applied as 3 rupees per day post the return due date of a book.
If a member is returning a book after the due date, the book will be returned and a balance will be due on the member. Before issuing a new book the balance will be paid by the member to the librarian. A member can view all available books, borrow a book, return a book, view their own books, and pay dues.

\### Main Class

The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the application. It handles user interactions and manages the flow of the library management system.

\### Book Class

The `Book` class represents individual books in the library. It stores information such as the book's title, author, total copies, and status. It also tracks borrowing and return times for fine calculation.

\### Member Class

The `Member` class represents library members. It stores member details like name, age, phone number, and fine. It also maintains a list of books borrowed by the member.

\### Librarian Class

The `Librarian` class manages library operations. It maintains collections of members and books and provides functionalities for librarians to register/remove members, add/remove books, and handle fines. It also allows librarians to view members' borrowing history and available books.
